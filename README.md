Independent implementation of Equiformer neural network

Attribution
This repository contains an independent re-implementation of the method introduced in:
Liao, Y. and Smidt, T., Equiformer: Equivariant Graph Attention Transformer for 3D Atomistic Graphs.
This code was written from scratch based on the published paper and does not reuse the original implementation.
